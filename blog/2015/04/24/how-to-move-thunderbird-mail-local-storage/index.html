<h1>How to Move Thunderbird Mail with &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;remote&rdquo; storage&#8221; from Win7 to Mac OS</h1>

<p>Many sites explain how to move Thunderbird mail environments easily from a PC (Win7) to a Mac (Yosemite). But, none that I attempted worked for me. That&rsquo;s probably because of my particular use of Thunderbird on this PC.</p>

<p>I use Thunderbird for remote server accounts (IMAP) AND I use &ldquo;Local Folders&rdquo; to save/archive old mail and my messages from RSS feeds are stored in the &ldquo;News &amp; Blogs&rdquo; area. WHen I tried the solutions I got some of my mail and/or settings but not all and my &ldquo;Local Folders&rdquo; mail was missing. Since I use that to archive more precious things, that was a real issue.</p>

<p>Looking around, I found that I had two profiles of the same name. Most solutions assumed that mail was either on a server or stored locally, or, at least, they did cover the case where the profile is split in two.</p>

<p>One profile was here on my PC:</p>

<pre><code>%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles\zwfok92z.default
</code></pre>

<p>This profile held most of the settings for folders and so on but none of the locally stored mail.</p>

<p>The other was here.</p>

<pre><code>%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\zwfok92z.default
</code></pre>

<p>Note they both had the same name and I verified that the dates on files in both locations were refreshed as I used Thunderbird.</p>

<p>Following the general instructions for moving the profile, I moved the &ldquo;Roaming&rdquo; profile first. THen I copied the &ldquo;Local&rdquo; profile over it. That merged the two.</p>

<p>All my settings and local mail reappeared.</p>

<p>Background on the use &ldquo;Local Folders&rdquo;: I copy folders or individual messages from the server account to the &ldquo;Local Folders&rdquo; area. After the messages are moved to the local store, I delete them from the server which a) reduces storage needs in the server; b) preserves some mail for as long as I need it; and c) seems to speed up Thunderbird. Since this is an archival step, I am willing to sacrifice the ability to read them remotely.</p>
